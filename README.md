# Vulnerability-detection-and-prevention
In this project, we aimed to show the possible vulnerabilities in a website, and then list possible solutions for the same. We created an intentionally vulnerable PHP website to test out these vulnerabilities and find methods on how to fix them.

We have checked for two vulnerabilities as of now. We will list one of the solutions below as well.

The website was built as a simple signup and login page linked to a PHP database. Accounts were created using the signup page and all testing was done via the signup and login page only.

// insert wesbite images here. use the signup page and login page.

## XSS Vulnerability
The first vulnerability we tested our website for is Cross Site Scripting (XSS). XSS attacks are a type of injection attacks in which malicious script is injected into trusted or benign websites.

### Issue
In the input box for name on the signup page, instead of putting the name, we put in a codeline which would take us to the youtube website.

```
<script>location.href"www.youtube.com"</script>
```
//add images here of the code in name box
The username and password were kept normal however. After signup, when someone logs in the account using the signin page, the link is activated and the user is sent to youtube website.

### Solution
The solution we used for solving XSS vulnerability is actually quite simple. Simply setting the

//add image of code where we make the change in code.

## SQL Injection Vulnerability
The second vulnerability we tested our website for is SQL injection. This is a code injection technique which works on your database and may cause irreversable harm.

### Issue
The vulnerability in the website is that the login page is vulnerable to MySQL code lines. If we put in the code below in the username input box, we can bypass the need to enter the password as long as we know the username. (NOTE : This is only applicable if an account has already been created with proper credentials i.e. no code lines in the input box during sign up)

```
username' OR 1=1#
```
OR
```
username'#
```
//add images of code

The username portion should be replaced by the username of the account you are trying to log into.

### Solution
Since the 

## Conclusion
As can be summarised via this project, there are multiple ways to alter the working of a website; hence we must always keep in mind the security of a website when coding it, especially when it may store important information.
