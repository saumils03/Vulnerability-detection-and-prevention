# Vulnerability-detection-and-prevention
In this project, we aimed to show the possible vulnerabilities in a website, and then list possible solutions for the same. We created an intentionally vulnerable PHP website to test out these vulnerabilities and find methods on how to fix them.

We have checked for two vulnerabilities as of now. We will list one of the solutions below as well.

The website was built as a simple signup and login page linked to a PHP database. Accounts are created using the signup page and login page leads to the dashboard page if login is successful.

## Languages
- MySQL (Database)
- PHP (Pages)

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
The first vulnerability we tested our website for is Cross Site Scripting (XSS). XSS attacks are a type of injection attacks in which malicious script is injected into a vulnerable website. The input if unsanitised leads to the execution of the script.

### Issue
In the input box for name on the signup page, instead of putting the name, we put in a normal Javascript code which would take us to the youtube website.

```
<script>location.href="www.youtube.com"</script>
```

After signup, when logging on the login page using the recently created credentials, the dashboard opens but almost instantly redirects to youtube. This is because the script that was entered in the name field gets interpreted as a script and is executed.

### Solution
The solution we used for solving XSS vulnerability is actually quite simple. Simply using the function htmlspecialchars() on the $name variable helps get rid of the vulnerability. It converts special characters to HTML entities, so symbols like '<' and '>' are converted to '&lt' and '&gt' respectively. What this achieves is that now the script isn't executed and is displayed as it is on the dashboard.



## SQL Injection (SQLi) Vulnerability
The second vulnerability we tested our website for is SQL injection. This is an attack technique in which SQL code is input which can modify the database if the input isn't sanitised.

### Issue
The login page is vulnerable to SQL injection attack. If we put in the two example codes below in the username input box, we can bypass the need to enter the password and can login as any user as long as we know their username.

```
username' AND 1=1#
```
or even
```
username'#
```
In the above two examples, the # symbol comments out whatever is in front of it. So, we manipulated the input in such a way that essentially the username is only input and the query logs in the attacker as the user.


### Solution
Instead of using the input as it is, the input received using the POST request should be input into a function called mysqli_real_escape_string() which escapes all the special characters for use in an SQL query. This will ensure that specially crafted SQL queries don't get interpreted as queries and just as normal inputs.

## How to Run
We hosted the pages on a local server on a windows machine using XAMPP.

## Conclusion
As can be summarised via this project, there are multiple ways to alter the working of a website; hence we must always keep in mind the security of a website when coding it, especially when it may store important information.
